Project Euler solutions in as many languages as possible

Languages covered:
- Ruby 1.9.3
- Lua 5.1
- Java 7

Languages that will never be covered:
- /(Objective)? C(++|#)?/ -- big nope
- JavaScript -- just... no
- Brainfuck -- wait, what
- GolfScript -- not aiming for the shortest code
- Scheme/Lisp -- functional programming iz 4 n00bz

Languages I might cover:
- J -- I actually want to try this, looks like it could be "lots of fun"
- Python -- might learn Python some day, so I'll use Python too
